As cliche as this seems we'll start with my name i guess
It's Kosisochukwu; Kosi for short
I am a dark-skinned, tall, igbo saracstic feminist who signs up for things that wll frustrate her in her spare time.
I am also a final year student in University of Ilorin
The aim of this was to write about myself in a new repository and  make it public
so if you are reading this, i did something right.
