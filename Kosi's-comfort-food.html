    <h1 class='title uppercase' id='article-title'>What do you know about African salad</h1>
    <p> African salad or Abacha as it should be known is one of the many pride and joys of the ndi igbo, living in the eastern part of Nigeria.What more could you ask of a meal that provides everything needed for a balanced diet and more. If it is not already obvious, I'm very passionate about it. So we'll be taking a deep dive into the culinary goodness that is Abacha.</p>

<h3>So how do we go about making this dish? Glad you asked.</h3>
    <p>
      <p><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i>You can either heat or soak the dry Abacha in boiled water for about three minutes, then sieve and keep on a separate bowl.</p>
      <p><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i>Blend your crayfish and also slice the onions, garden egg leaves.</p>
      <p><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i>Grab the seperate bowl with the abacha and get ready to mix all the ingredients thoroughly</p>
      <p><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i>Add about 100ml of palm oil</p>
      <p><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i>Then add the ground crayfish and pepper</p>
      <p><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i>Add the ugba to the mixture and continue to mix.Be adding salt to taste</p>
      <p><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i>Stir the whole combination and you are almost through with the preparation part.</p>
    </p>
<h3>The Jara</h3>
    <p>The garden eggs, the leaves, and the onions are used to spice up or for decoration and not added during preparation but while dishing out.They sliced and kept aside in different plates or bowls, then added while the individual plates are dished out; this also goes for the meat or fish used.Serve with the meat and also add the garden eggs (sliced) and leaves to individual plate.I usually pair this with a chilled glass of palmwine</p>
